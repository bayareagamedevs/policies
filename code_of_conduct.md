# Bay Area Game Devs Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

A primary goal of Bay Area Game Devs is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in Bay Area Game Devs to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## 2. Positive Culture

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to support positive culture by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

## 3. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

  * Use your full name for your profile. This is primarily to avoid confusion and abuse of anonymity.
  * Thread your conversations in any auto-add channels. This keeps channels clean, and messages easy to parse.
  * Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
  * Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
  * Attempt collaboration before conflict.
  * Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
  * Exercise discretion and respect when using @ for individuals. @ing someone will send a notification to them. This should only occur when the message to that person is urgent, or you are attempting to bring their attention to something they might not see otherwise (for instance, if they are not active in a channel you are posting in).
    - e.g. Do not @ people who you are engaged in direct conversation with. They will see your message without the @.
  * Exercise discretion and respect when Direct Messaging. Similar to @'s, DMs send a notification to whoever is in the DM (it can be multiple people), and it suggests the nature of the DM is urgent.
  * Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
  * Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.
  * Be nice! We reserve the authority to ban members for any behavior we deem unacceptable.

## 4. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community. This list is inclusive but not exhaustive:

  * Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
  * Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
  * Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
  * Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
  * Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
  * Inappropriate photography or recording.
  * Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone's consent before touching them.
  * Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, or groping; and unwelcomed sexual advances of any kind.
  * Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
  * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
  * Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.

## 5. Weapons Policy

No weapons will be allowed at Bay Area Game Devs events, community spaces, or in other spaces covered by the scope of this Code of Conduct. Weapons include but are not limited to guns, explosives (including fireworks), and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon. Community members are further expected to comply with all state and local laws on this matter.

## 6. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

## 7. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. Please email bayareagamedevs@gmail.com, or send a private message to @tessercat or @bentle_giant in such an event.

Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

Once organizers have been made aware of an incident, we will review all information and conduct an appropriate investigation and discussion relative to the incident. Any incidents that result in accusations of violations and actions to correct such violations will be expressly communicated to all applicable parties.

## 8. Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify bayareagamedevs@gmail.com or PM @tessercat or @bentle_giant with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.

## 9. Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues--online and in-person--as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
